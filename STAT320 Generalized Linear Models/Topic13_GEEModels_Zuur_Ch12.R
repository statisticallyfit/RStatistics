# CALIFORNIA BIRD DATA: ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Time series of several water bird species recorded in California rice fields. 
# Main goals were to determine whether flooding fields after harvesting results in 
# greater use by aquatic birds, whether different methods of manipulating the straw 
# in conjunction with flooding influences how many fields are used, and whether the 
# depth that thefields are flooded to is important.

# Counts were made during winter surveys at several fields. Here, we only use
# data measured from one winter (1993â€“1994), and we use species richness to summarise 
# the 49 bird species recorded. The sampling took place at multiple sites, and
# from each site, multiple fields were repeatedly sampled. Here, we only use one site
# (called 4mile) for illustrative purposes.

      panel.loess(x, y, col=1, lwd=2)
})

# INTERPRET: 
# There are 11 fields in this site, and each
# field was repeatedly sampled; see Fig. 12.1. Note that there is a general decline in
# bird numbers over time. One of the available covariates is water depth per field, but
#water depth and time are collinear (as can be inferred from making an xyplot of
# depth versus time for each field), so we avoid using them together as covariates in
# the models.



# GOAL of study: explain the richness values as a function of dpeth and management
# fefects. 
# Response = count (poisson glm)
##### OFFSET: need offset because original data were dnesities; numbers per field, and
# the sizes of the fields are different, so log of size of field is offset variable.

#### OWL DATA ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# parents counted during 30-second time intervals before arrival of parent
# divided by number of siblings)
# So response: 
# Y_it = NCalls_it at time (t) in nest (i)
# NCalls_it ~ Pois(mu_it)
### Predictors: 
# Gender of parent = male or female
# Food treatment = deprived or satiated
# Arrival time of parent to nest: 21 to 30 (9:00 pm to 6:00 am)
# offset: number of nestlings

# --> gender_ijt = gender of deer (j) on farm (i) at time (t)

### GEE (Generalized Estimating Equations) ============================================


# DEFINITION GEE: 
# --> GLMM using autocorrelation in errors. 
# --> Just fixed effects, no random effects. 
# --> Similar to a random intercepts model, where for lme the random intercepts is the blocking
# variable for the GEE (id = block in GEE and random = ~1|block in random intercepts)
### GEE: id = blockVariable(i)
### LME: random = ~1|block
# --> Called a marginal model, where marginal refers to its dependence only on covariates. 
# --> GEE is useful if you have many blocks (i) and few longitudinal observations
# per blocking variable (i)


# Has Association sructure between Y_is, and Y_it, where (s) and (t) are two
# different points in time on the same group (i) from which the repeated measures
# are taken. 


# About GEE model structure: https://hyp.is/qbmz_thJEemDPO_-puJrLA/newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat504/node/180/




# ASSOCIATION STRUCTURES FOR ASSOCIATION BETWEEN Y_IS, and Y_IT: 

# Let alpha_st denote correlation between observations at times (s) and (t). 
# Prerequisite: response Y must be continuous. 

# The association structure between Y_is and Y_it is represented in terms of a matrix
# where each cell (block) contains a value alpha_st representing the correlation between
# time (s) and time (t) for an individual or group or area (i)


# (1) UNSTRUCTURED CORRELATION: 

# ---> FORMULA: cor(Y_is, Y_it) = alpha_st = pearson cor             (for Y = continuous)
# is the correlation between two time obs (s), (t) from same object (i) (nest/farm...)

# --> Used when temporally sequential observations come from the same source. 
# (Example: blood pressure reading taken from same patient at regular time intervals)

# ---> Independently-estimated correlations: 
# The cells contain correlations alpha_12, alpha_13, alpha_14, .. alpha_342..
# No correlation between these parameters is assumed (estimated independently). 
# MEANING: all correlations between within-subject observations are estimated 
# independently. 
# (this incurs computational cost)




# (2) AR-1 CORRELATION (AUTOREGRESSIVE)

# ---> FORMULA: cor(Y_is, Y_it) = alpha ^ |s - t|
# is the defined correlation between two time observations (s), (t) from the same (i) block (patient, field, nest, farm)

# ----> Autoregressive correlation is observed in real-life when within-subject time 
# correlations can be modeled as "distance" of the time observations.

# ----> Used for any data when there is time / depth / age. 



# (3) EXCHANGEABLE CORRELATION: 

# ---> FORMULA: cor(Y_is, Y_it) = alpha = constant
# Meaning: this just says that the response of a batch of subjects from the same site
# are correlated. 
# Does not consider temporal or sequential correlation. 
# Ignores within-site spatial correlation. 
# Another name: "compound-symmetry correlation"
# Equivalent to RANDOM INTERCEPTS. 


# (4) STATIONARY CORRELATION: 

# Is Autoregressive up to a point then drops. 
# Example: consecutive blood readings taken every time unit; autoregressive up to a 
# time lag of 2 hours then ceases. 



#### Applicability of Each Correlation to Bird / Deer / Owl: 
# (ignoring non-continuous response, which has to be continuous for correlation strct)

# BIRD: 
### ----> each block of correlation (cell) is for a field. 
### ----> Unstructured: 
# Can use unstructured correlation matrix because observations 1,2 in field 1
# and observations 1,2 in field 2 may be temporally related. 
### ----> Autoregressive AR1: 
# Good option; correlation between fields separated by one time unit (2 weeks) is likely
# to be more similar than those separated by larger time units. 

# OWL: 
### ----> each block of correlation (matrix cell) is for a nest. 
### ----> Unstructured: 
# Assuming the arrival time of owls is regularly spaced, we can use unstructured
# correlation. Then alpha_12 represents correlation between arrivals 1 and 2 (at nest 2?), and
# alpha_13 represents correlation between arrivals 1 and 3...
### ----> Autoregressive AR1: 
# Only make sense if we cosnider the time order in the data. 

# DEER: 
### ----> each block of correlation (matrix cell) is for a farm. 
### ----> Unstructured: 
# Nonsense to use unstructured correlation because there is no relation
# between animals 1,2 at farm 1 (cell 1) and animals 1,2 at farm 2 (cell 2)
### ----> Autoregressive AR1: 
# No sense since there is no tiem order in the sampled deer per farm.
